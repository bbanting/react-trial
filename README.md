# React Yahtzee

My first react project. A web version of a favourite game. See the most recent deployment at https://bbanting.github.io/react-yahtzee/.

## TODO:
- Yahtzee animation?
- Prevent accidental double-click on roll
- phone zoom in bug?
- prevent roll when all dice locked
- stats overlay animation
- fix roll counting
