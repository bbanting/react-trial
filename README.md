My first react project. A web version of a favourite game. See the most recent deployment at https://bbanting.github.io/react-yahtzee/.

## TODO:
- Endgame stats overlay
- Highscore functionality
- Yahtzee animation?
- Fix timer (or delete timer?)
- Prevent accidental double-click on roll
- "click roll" indicator
- phone zoom in bug?
